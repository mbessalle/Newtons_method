# Newtons_method
a program that will use Newton’s method for finding approximations of roots
of functions, to find solutions to algebraic equations with integer coefficients
(like 3x2 - 5x - 7 = 0).
The input for the program will contain the following three lines:
<algebraic equation><eoln>
<number of repetitions><eoln>
<initial guess for a root><eoln>
<algebraic equation> is a list of integers.
The list 2 5 -3 2 4 1 1 0 stands for 2x5-3x2+4x1+1x0 = 0 or 2x5-3x2+4x+1 = 0.
<number of repetitions> is the number of times that Newton’s method should
be applied.
<initial guess for a root> is the starting value for Newton’s method.
<eoln> stands for "end of line".
